# Why write goals?

It's important to write goals each year to help with our professional development. Goals are a good way to unite you and your manager on specific causes and get visibility on important problems that both you and your manager want to solve.

Goals for a member of a software engineering team should focus on advancing your career by improving either your technical or soft skills -- depending on which the company needs and which the employee wants.

Goals should be tracked by both management and the employee, and should include key results to track progress. You and your manager should create a few goals each year and work with leadership to track progress towards completing said goals.

Remember that it is impossible for you and your manager to remember everything that you as an employee do; goals are a way to communicate and receive credit for doing work that is meaningful to both of you.

## SMART Goals

The Smart criteria are often used to help write good goals. They can be broken down like so:

- Specific: Goals should be as specific as possible. Focus on a specific area of technology, a part of a system, or a specific soft skill to improve on.
- Measurable: It should be possible to measure progress towards completing each goal in some fashion.
- Assignable: Goals have to be owned by someone, or a group of people. If not, who will do the task?
- Realistic: The goal must be realistically achievable with the given time and resources.
- Time Bound: Goals have to specify a deadline to complete a goal.
