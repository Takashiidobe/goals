# Refactoring a Codebase from Python2 to Python3

Here's an example goal, refactoring a codebase from Python2 to Python3

## Goal

In our company, we have a few codebases that have run without issue for many years; one of them includes a Python2 ML processing pipeline that our data scientists rely on for day to day use. As Python2 was EOLed in 2020, and will no longer receive security updates, we believe that it is a risk to leave it in its current state. Thus, this goal is around having the project run on Python3 by the end of the year. We will do quarterly deadlines where 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the code written must be able to run on python3 by SLOC.

## Criteria

- Specific: One project must be properly running in production on a different version of python.
- Measurable: It is possible to measure progress by using SLOC that can run on python3, in quarters.
- Assignable: Goal is owned by someone.
- Realistic: This project is doable with the given resources.
- Time Bound: There is a clear deadline, end of year 2021.
